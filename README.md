This is a clone of Galaga that I made on Java

It has a res folder with all 47 16x16 images that are used for lasers, aliens, the player, buttons, and explosions

It has multiple types of aliens and creates the different aliens as a subclass of the alien class and then it can all be in the array that gets updated consistently at a set fps.
